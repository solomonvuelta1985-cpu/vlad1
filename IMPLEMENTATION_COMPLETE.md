    <button class="btn btn-success btn-sm"
            onclick="openPaymentModal({

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### PDF Not Generating
**Problem:** Receipt PDF doesn't download
**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify Dompdf installed
composer show dompdf/dompdf

# Check if vendor/autoload.php exists
ls vendor/autoload.php

# Reinstall if needed
composer require dompdf/dompdf
```

### OR Numbers Not Sequential
**Problem:** Receipt numbers skip or duplicate
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check sequence table
SELECT * FROM receipt_sequence;

-- Reset if needed (BE CAREFUL!)
UPDATE receipt_sequence SET current_number = 0 WHERE id = 1;
```

### Citation Status Not Updating
**Problem:** Payment recorded but citation still "pending"
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SHOW TRIGGERS LIKE 'after_payment_insert';

-- Re-run trigger script if needed
SOURCE database/migrations/add_payment_triggers.sql;
```

### Access Denied
**Problem:** Can't access payment pages
**Solution:**
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check user role (admin or enforcer)
- Verify session in `includes/auth.php`
